Welcome to the PDBe-KB User Guide!
===================================

This User Guide provides information about the data pipelines and functional annotations available
at the `Protein Data Bank in Europe - Knowledge Base <https://pdbe-kb>`_.

PDBe-KB is an open, collaborative consortium of structural biologist data providers.
We enrich the structure data of the PDB archive with functional annotations. We also provide uniform access to
experimentally-determined and computationally predicted protein structures through the
`3D-Beacons network <https://3d-beacons.org>`_.

PDBe-KB is a flagship of the `ELIXIR 3D-BioInfo Community <https://elixir-europe.org/communities/3d-bioinfo>`_,
an international group of researchers and software developers working on improving all the aspects of data management
in the field of structural bioinformatics.
